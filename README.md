## Overview

*earkweb* is a web application with a  task execution backend based on 
[Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org) which supports the parallel processing of information. 

### Services used

#### Celery 

Celery is an open-source, distributed task queue that allows you to run time-consuming or periodic tasks in the background.

#### Celery beat

Celery Beat is a scheduler that runs alongside Celery workers to execute periodic tasks at specified intervals.

#### Flower (Celery)

Flower is a real-time web-based monitoring tool for Celery that provides detailed insights into task progress, worker status, and system performance.

#### Apache Solr

Apache Solr is an open-source search platform built on Apache Lucene, designed for full-text search and indexing capabilities.

### Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the component architecture.

![architecture overview lightweight version](./docs/img/architecture_overview_lightweightversion.png)

The user interface represented by the box on top of the diagram is a 
[Python](https://www.python.org)/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)-based web application which supports creation,
 management and exploration of information packages. Tasks can be assigned to Celery workers (green boxes with 
a "C") which share the same storage area and the result of the package transformation is stored in the information 
packageâ€™s working directory based on files. Full-text content included in information packages is indexed by SolR.
A [ResourceSync](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/toc) interface exposes the changelist of information packages managed 
by the repository.
