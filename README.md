## Software architecture

*earkweb* is a web application with a  task execution backend based on 
[Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org) which supports the parallel processing of information. 

The following diagram illustrates the component architecture.

![architecture overview lightweight version](./docs/img/architecture_overview_lightweightversion.png)

The user interface represented by the box on top of the diagram is a 
[Python](https://www.python.org)/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)-based web application which supports creation,
 management and exploration of information packages. Tasks can be assigned to Celery workers (green boxes with 
a "C") which share the same storage area and the result of the package transformation is stored in the information 
packageâ€™s working directory based on files. Full-text content included in information packages is indexed by SolR.
A [ResourceSync](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/toc) interface exposes the changelist of information packages managed 
by the repository.
